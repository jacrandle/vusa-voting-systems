- **Fuzzing inputs** in a controlled manner

### ‚ùå Prohibited Testing
- **Accessing other users' data** or sessions
- **Disrupting service** for other users
- **Automated scanning** that might impact performance
- **Testing on production educational sessions** without permission
- **Social engineering** attacks against users

## üìö Educational Considerations

### Student Data Protection
Since this tool is used in educational settings:
- **FERPA compliance** issues are considered security vulnerabilities
- **Student privacy** breaches are treated as critical
- **Educational session isolation** failures are high priority
- **Instructor data access** problems require immediate attention

### Responsible Disclosure for Educational Tools
- **Consider academic calendar** when planning disclosure
- **Minimize disruption** to ongoing educational use
- **Provide clear guidance** for educators on security updates
- **Offer assistance** with data migration if needed
