# Contributing to VUSA Individual Voting System

Thank you for your interest in improving this Congressional voting simulation! We welcome contributions from political scientists, educators, developers, and civic engagement enthusiasts.

## üéØ Ways to Contribute

### üìö Political Science & Educational Expertise
- **Formula Refinements**: Suggest improvements to vote weighting based on political science research
- **Historical Accuracy**: Help validate our simulation against real Congressional procedures
- **Educational Use Cases**: Share classroom experiences and suggest pedagogical improvements
- **Documentation**: Improve explanations of political concepts and procedures

### üíª Technical Contributions
- **Bug Fixes**: Report and fix issues with the voting calculations or UI
- **Feature Development**: Add new functionality like committee systems or amendment processes
- **Performance**: Optimize calculations and data synchronization
- **Accessibility**: Improve keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and mobile experience

### üé® Design & User Experience
- **Interface Improvements**: Enhance the visual design and user flow
- **Data Visualization**: Better charts and displays for voting results
- **Mobile Optimization**: Improve the mobile and tablet experience
- **Internationalization**: Add support for other languages and legislative systems

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Congressional procedures (helpful but not required)
- Familiarity with JavaScript, HTML, CSS for technical contributions
- GitHub account for submitting contributions

### Development Setup
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vusa-voting-system.git
   cd vusa-voting-system
   ```
3. **Open `index.html`** in your browser to test locally
4. **Make your changes** following the guidelines below
5. **Test thoroughly** with different scenarios and browsers

### Testing Your Changes
- **Create test scenarios** with various party compositions
- **Test vote calculations** manually to ensure accuracy
- **Verify Google Sheets sync** if modifying data handling
- **Check mobile responsiveness** on different screen sizes
- **Test offline functionality** by disconnecting from internet

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Use clear, descriptive variable names** (e.g., `partyLeaderVoteWeight` not `plvw`)
- **Comment complex calculations** especially vote weighting logic
- **Follow existing patterns** for consistency
- **Keep functions focused** on single responsibilities
- **Use semicolons** and consistent indentation

### Political Science Accuracy
- **Research-backed changes**: Cite academic sources for formula modifications
- **Real-world validation**: Test against historical voting patterns when possible
- **Bipartisan approach**: Ensure the system doesn't favor any particular political viewpoint
- **Transparent methodology**: Document the reasoning behind vote weight calculations

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `feat: add committee voting system`
- `fix: correct scaling in vote weight calculation`
- `docs: update README with new features`
- `style: improve mobile layout for faction display`

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports
When reporting bugs, please include:
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Browser and device** information
- **Screenshots or screen recordings** if helpful
- **Sample data** that triggers the bug

### Feature Requests
For new features, please provide:
- **Use case description**: Who would benefit and how?
- **Political science context**: How does this reflect real Congressional processes?
- **Implementation suggestions**: Any ideas on how it might work?
- **Educational value**: How would this help in teaching or learning?

## üîç Types of Contributions We Especially Need

### High Priority
- **Mobile optimization** - improve touch interface and responsive design
- **Accessibility improvements** - keyboard navigation, screen readers
- **Performance optimization** - faster calculations with large numbers of senators
- **Educational documentation** - lesson plans, teaching guides

### Medium Priority
- **Historical vote recreation** - pre-built scenarios based on famous votes
- **Committee system** - add committee markup and voting processes
- **Amendment process** - support for bill amendments and substitutes
- **Data export improvements** - CSV, PDF formats for results

### Future Considerations
- **International legislatures** - support for parliamentary systems
- **AI opponents** - computer-controlled factions for solo play
- **Lobbying simulation** - external influence mechanics
- **Advanced analytics** - voting pattern analysis and predictions
